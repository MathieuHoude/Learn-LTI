# Frequently Asked Questions

### Issues in deployment

In order to understand the issue in more detail, one way could be to go through the deployment details which could be accessed via Azure Portal. Double check the setting with 
[the deployment guide](/docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)

Go to Azure Portal -> Choose appropriate Subscription -> Select Resource Groups blade from Left Rail -> Choose appropriate Resource Group -> Select Deployments Blade from Left Rail.

The deployment step which failed should be easily identified and debugged.

If the error is related to an Azure region please try to redeploy to a suitable alternative region.

If the error is related to missing subscription registration please make sure the following resource providers are registered in your subscription - 
- Microsoft.Web
- Microsoft.Storage
- Microsoft.Insights
- Microsoft.KeyVault
- Microsoft.Authorization

To see the registration status and register a resource provider namespace see [Resolve errors for resource provider registration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/error-register-resource-provider#solution-3---azure-portal)

## Reporting

Microsoft Learn organizational Reporting is a service available to organizations to view Microsoft Learn training progress and achievements of the individuals within their tenant. This service is available to both enterprise customers and educational organizations.The system uses a service called Azure Data Share to extract, transform, and load (ETL) user progress data into data sets, which can then be processed further or displayed in visualization tools such as Power BI. Data sets can be stored to either Azure Data Lake, Azure Blob storage, Azure SQL database, or Azure Synapse SQL Pool. Organizations can create and manage their data share using Azure Data Share’s no-code UI.

## Cost Management
The cost of the service implementation is approximately $20 per month for the Azure infrastructure which is required for the Microsoft Learn LTI Application. Costs can be assessed by using the [Azure Pricing Calculator]( https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator?WT.mc_id=academic-80547-leestott)

## What do you need to deploy the Microsoft Learn LTI Application
Your Instititution will need to have 
- Azure tenant 
- Azure Subscription 
- Azure Active Directory for user Authentication

## What LTI data will be passing from the LMS into Learn…
We are only user membership service within LTI. We are using the membership service to gain a list of members of the course to surface in the Learn LTI Application. All Data resides in the institution as the Learn LTI Application is installed within your Azure Tenant. We are not transferring anything to MS Learn or from MS Learn to the institutional LMS see the [Architecure Diagram.](ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md)

## How can we track user Microsoft Learn. 
A user/student will login to Microsoft Learn using their Org AAD/microsoft365  user reporting to the institution is provided to only their Org account and this is done securly and we don't hold user details these are reconciled by the institution using Azure Data Services and [Microsoft Learn Organizational Reporting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/support/org-reporting)

## Will the LTI be sharing gradebook or assessment data? 
At this point Microsoft Learn does not support LTI Gradebook passback. Therefore your institution need to build a manual process for assessment of completed works. 

## Azure Compliance 
90 compliance certifications, including over 50 specific to global regions and countries, such as the US, the European Union, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, India, and China. And, get more than 35 compliance offerings specific to the needs of key industries, including health, government, finance, education, manufacturing, and media. Your emerging compliance needs are covered, too: Microsoft engages globally with governments, regulators, standards bodies, and non-governmental organizations. Explore [Azure compliance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/regulatory/offering-home) you can find more details on [compliance](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/trusted-cloud/compliance/)

## FERPA-protected Data
Microsoft only validate the users/students to Microsoft Learn using their microsoft365/AAD usernames we store no other details related to the user apart from there login. It is the institution responsibility and reconcile users activity using the [Microsoft Learn Organizational Reporting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/support/org-reporting) the institition can build associated activity reports around there users/students. Again as the Learn LTI Application is installed, managed and operated by the Institution we recommend you read [this paper](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/microsoft-azure-ferpa-implementation-guide/) as its helpful to those in educational organizations who need guidance and best practices in designing secure solutions on Azure. 

## Public Health/HIPAA PCI/DSS as FISMA 
The requirements are out of scope for Microsoft Learn. 

## Microsoft Professional Certifications
The purchasing of Microsoft Certification is processed via a learning partner as is the certification process and exam which sits outside of MS Learn API feature as we are simply bringing back modules, learning paths at this point.
